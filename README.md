# Magento 2 - Sub Category Listing

For Magento 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x and 2.4.x

## Benefits

The Sub Category Listing module allows you to present a list of child categories on any category page on the frontend of your website. This improves navigation on the frontend and can help users find what they're looking for quickly and easily, while still keeping control in the user's hands.

## Production usage

Magento Admin > Catalog > Categories

When clicking into a category in admin, you will see a "Show Sub Category Listing" attribute. Setting this to yes will automatically show all of the available sub categories for that category, using their URL, name and image

## Installation

```
composer require zero1/module-sub-category-listing
```
